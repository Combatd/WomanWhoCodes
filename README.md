# WomanWhoCodes
Spark AR Application to inspire women who code by making them feel magical

## Inspiration
* There was a sample application that looped through and randomly assigned users a programming language to appear over their head!
* We want to remind women that they are awesome pursuing technology careers, no matter what language they like.
* Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon!

## What it does
* Filter that randomly selects a coding superpower related to a language
* Gives user a Tiara!

## How I built i
## Challenges I ran into
This was the first time we have used Spark AR Studio. Much of our morning was spent familiarizing ourselves with the interface and the logic required to build animations and layers.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

## What I learned

Sometimes documentation cannot be updated as fast as the actual application itself. We had to experiment to figure out new features in the current version of Spark AR.

## What's next for WomanWhoCodes

* Implement changing tiaras and sparkles!
* Custom animations for facial expression
